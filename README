Very preliminary README:

You will need recent g++ (at least 4.7) to build most of the code. Also
libdwarf, libunwind, boost, and other things you probably already have.

The easiest way to get started is probably to look at the (smaller) 
examples in examples/.

Configuration: none of these codebases is autotooled. I handle
configuration by creating per-machine "makefile" (or config.mk) 
alongside each top-level Makefile, of the form

CXXFLAGS += ...
LDFLAGS += ...
include Makefile

Completeness: various things are part-done, like the DWARF evaluator 
(only supports the opcodes I've needed so far) and support for multiple 
DWARF standards (mostly there, but not hooked up properly; in practice 
it doesn't matter too much).
